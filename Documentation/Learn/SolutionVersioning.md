# Solution versioning

Solution versioning is when projects in a solution share the same versioning.
Solution versioning is used to allow for all assemblies in a project to have the same version.

[Git2SemVer.Tool](xref:git2semver-tool) configures a solution to use solution versioning.
It will add a new versioning project and configure other projects to use versioning information from the versioning project.

## Build numbering

On an uncontrolled host (typically a dev box) solution versioning will:

* Maintain a host build number that is used by all solutions.
* On a solution rebuild or on first build after cloning a repository, 
bump the build number and result in all assemblies having the same version.
* On a project build bump the build number if that project has already been built using the current build number.
* A project nuget pack always uses the same version as the project's build.

### Scenario - Multiple clones of a repository on a dev box

Preconditions: 

* The developer has two clones of a repository. Clone 1 and Clone 2.
* The last build number on the dev box was 1000.
* Last Clone 1 build, on this dev box, was 10.0.0-DevBox.900.
* Last Clone 2 build, on this dev box, was 20.0.0-DevBox.950.

Scenario:

| Action                              | Clone 1                | Clone 2 |
|:--                                  | :---:                  | :---:     |
| Clone 1 is rebuilt.                 | **10.0.0-DevBox.1001** | 20.0.0-DevBox.950  |
| Clone 1 is rebuilt (again).         | **10.0.0-DevBox.1002** | 20.0.0-DevBox.950  |
| Clone 2 is rebuilt.                 | 10.0.0-DevBox.1002     | **20.0.0-DevBox.1003** |


### Scenario - Solution with multiple projects on dev box

Preconditions: 

* The solution has 3 projects: Project A, Project B1, Project B2.
* Project B2 is dependent Project B1.
* The solution has been built. Build number was 1000.

Scenario:

Build numbers shown for each project.

| Action                                                    | Project A | Project B | Project C |
|:--                                                        | :---:     | :---:     | :---:     |
| Code is changed in project A. On build (not rebuild).        | **1001** | 1000     | 1000     |
| Code is changed in project B2. Solution build (not rebuild). | 1001     | **1002** | **1002** |
| Code is changed in project A. Solution build (not rebuild).  | **1002** | 1002     | 1002     |
| Solution rebuilt.                                            | **1003** | **1003** | **1003** |


### Scenario - Pack on dev box

Preconditions: 

* Last build number was 1000.

Scenario:

Build numbers shown for each project.

| Action                                                    | Build number |
|:--                                                        | :---:        |
| Project build (no pack).                                  | **1001**     |
| Project pack without build.                               | 1001         |
| Project build with pack.                                  | **1002**     |
