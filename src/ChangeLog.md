For futher information see: [Upgrading V2 to V3](https://noetictools.github.io/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/Reference/Upgrading/UpgradingV2toV3).

* Further information in logs/report as to how the version is calculated ([#42](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/42)).
* Add warning and error IDs for MSBuild integration ([#41](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/41)).

### Changed

* **Breaking change -** Improve build statistic naming  ([#44](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/44)).

## 2.0.0 - _December 1, 2024_

This release has breaking changes that will impact users that are either:
* Using the generated JSON `Git2SemVer.VersionInfo.g.json` file in custom code.
* Using the Git API in custom C# script (csx) code.

### Added

* C# scripting (csx):
  * `IGitTool` fluent API added ([#5](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.Core/issues/5)).
  * `IGitTool` functionality to get commits between revision ranges ([#5](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.Core/issues/5)).

### Changed

* **Breaking change** to generated JSON file `Git2SemVer.VersionInfo.g.json`. These will only impact users using this file externally.
    * CommitId `Id` property renamed to `Sha`.
    * `CommitChangeTypeId` enumb `None` value (1) added. All higher numbers bumped.
    * `Rev` bumped to `2`.
    * Others
* **Breaking change** `IGitTool` method signatures changed. Introduced Fluent API.
* TeamCity automatic build label updating now adds build number metadata to release build label, e.g: 1.2.3+34567 ([#33](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/33)). 

### Fixed

* On a new repo without any release tags, conventional commit version bumps are ignored ([#34](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/34)).


## 1.2.0 - _November 26, 2024_

### Changed

* Changed the build system label, as used by TeamCity, to include build number on release builds ([#33](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/33)).
* Moved Git2SemVer.Tool (dotnet tool) code to its own repository.

### Known Issues

* Versioning fails build when TeamCity build configuration's VCS Root uses the option "Use tags as branches" is set ([#32](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer.MSBuild/issues/32)). A compile time exception is thrown.

 
## 1.1.0 - _November 16, 2024_

### Added

* Added [Cross targeted projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file) support ([#26](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/26)).
* Added versioning log file ([#26](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/2)).
* Added [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) support for versioning.

### Fixed

* On an uncontrolled host with solution open in Visual Studio, build number updates in background every few seconds ([#28](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/28)).
* On an uncontrolled host prior build number is reused on first build after new clone ([#27](https://github.com/NoeticTools/Git2SemVer/issues/27)).
